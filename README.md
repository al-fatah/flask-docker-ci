## 🐳 Flask Docker CI/CD with GitHub Actions

This project demonstrates how to containerize a Flask application using Docker and automate the build & push process to Docker Hub using GitHub Actions.
Every push to the main branch triggers a workflow that builds the Docker image and publishes it to your Docker Hub registry.
